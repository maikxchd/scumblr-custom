# Deploying Scumblr 2.0 as a Threat Intelligence Tool

Scumblr is a Netflix open source project that allows performing periodic searches and storing / taking actions on the identified results. While the project has been abandoned by Netflix, this small change to the system will be able to better suit the needs of Tech Companies searching for databreaches in sites like 4chan to RaidForums.

## Follow Scumblr 2.0 & Sketchy Docs to build

https://github.com/Netflix/Scumblr/wiki/Setting-up-Scumblr-2.0-(New-install)

https://github.com/Netflix/Sketchy/wiki

#### Configure Scumblr to use Sketchy:

The :host option can also use an IP address and/or include the port if non-standard (i.e. "192.168.10.101:3000")
```
$ vi Scumblr/config/environments/development.rb
Rails.application.routes.default_url_options[:host] = "localhost:3000"
```

```
$ vi Scumblr/config/initializers/scumblr.rb
config.sketchy_url = "https://127.0.0.1/api/v1.0/capture"
config.sketchy_use_ssl = "sketchy_use_ssl" == "false" ? false : true # Does sketchy use ssl?
config.sketchy_verify_ssl = "false" ? false : true # Should scumblr verify sketchy's cert
#config.sketchy_tag_status_code = "sketchy_tag_status_code" # Add a tag indicating last status code sketchy received
#config.sketchy_access_token = "sketchy_access_token"
```

## Creating Sketchy and Scumblr Services
you can create a service for scumblr and sketchy.

### Scumblr service

$ vi controller/start_scumblr.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
# start scumblr
cd /home/maikxchd/Scumblr
nohup redis-server &>/dev/null & ../.rbenv/shims/bundle exec sidekiq -d -l log/sidekiq.log & nohup ../.rbenv/shims/bundle exec rails s -b 0.0.0.0 &>/dev/null &
```


$ vi controller/stop_scumblr.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'sidekiq 4.2.10 Scumblr'
ps aux | grep 'sidekiq 4.2.10 Scumblr' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'rails master -b'
ps aux | grep 'rails master -b' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'rails worker'
ps aux | grep 'rails worker' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'redis-server'
ps aux | grep 'redis-server' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

$ vi controller/scumblr
```
#!/bin/bash
# Scumblr Control /etc/init.d/ script
#
# Copy this file into /etc/init.d/ then chmod +x (add execution options) it and 'update-rc.d scumblr defaults'
#

case $1 in
        start)
                sudo -u maikxchd /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/Scumblr/controller/start_scumblr.sh
        ;;
        stop)
                sudo -u maikxchd /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/Scumblr/controller/stop_scumblr.sh
        ;;
        restart)
                sudo -u maikxchd /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/Scumblr/controller/stop_scumblr.sh
                sudo -u maikxchd /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/Scumblr/controller/start_scumblr.sh
        ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Set permissions and move service
```
$ chmod a+x controller/start_scumblr.sh
$ chmod a+x controller/stop_scumblr.sh
$ chmod a+x controller/scumblr
$ sudo cp controller/scumblr /etc/init.d/

update init.d service
$ update-rc.d scumblr defaults
```

### Sketchy Service
Create sketchy service

$ vi sketchy/controller/stop_sketchy.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
# stop nginx
service nginx stop
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'supervisord -c'
ps aux | grep 'supervisord -c' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'celery worker'
ps aux | grep 'celery worker' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
# Grabs and kill a process from the pidlist that has the word 'gunicorn sketchy:app'
ps aux | grep 'gunicorn sketchy:app' | awk '{print $2}' | xargs kill -9
```

$ vi sketchy/controller/start_sketchy.sh
```
#!/bin/bash
service nginx start
cd /home/maikxchd/sketchy
source sketchenv/bin/activate
supervisord -c supervisor/supervisord.ini
exit
```


$ vi sketchy/controller/sketchy
```
#!/bin/bash
# Sketchy Control /etc/init.d/ script
#
# Copy this file into /etc/init.d/ then chmod +x (add execution options) it and 'update-rc.d sketchy defaults'
#

case $1 in
        start)
                /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/sketchy/controller/start_sketchy.sh
        ;;
        stop)
                /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/sketchy/controller/stop_sketchy.sh
        ;;
        restart)
                /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/sketchy/controller/stop_sketchy.sh
                /bin/bash /home/maikxchd/sketchy/controller/start_sketchy.sh
        ;;
esac
exit 0
```

Make permission changes
```
$ chmod a+x sketchy/controller/start_sketchy.sh
$ chmod a+x sketchy/controller/stop_sketchy.sh
$ chmod a+x sketchy/controller/sketchy
$ sudo cp sketchy/controller/sketchy /etc/init.d/

update init.d service
$ update-rc.d sketchy defaults
```

## Running Scumblr
```
$ sudo service scumblr [start|stop|restart]
```

## Running Sketchy
```
$ sudo service sketchy [start|stop|restart]
```

# Automatic Syncing

rake sync_all will run all searches, generate emails, and use sketchy if configured

To do each function seperately:

- $ rake perform_searches # run all searches
- $ rake send_email_updates # send notifications

To set up a cron job:

- $ crontab -e
- \*/20 \* \* \* \* cd /home/maikxchd/Scumblr && /home/maikxchd/.rbenv/shims/rake run_tasks

To run rake commands as root (not required), You will need to symlink rake to /usr/bin.

	- $ which rake
	- $ which rake1.9.1
	- $ sudo ln -s /home/<USER>/.rbenv/shims/rake /usr/bin/rake


# Configuring Search Providers

Copy this repo's custom search providers into Scumblr's lib directory. The instructions below will guide you through building the necessary APIs for each search provider.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/maikxchd/scumblr_custom.git
$ cp search\ providers/* /Scumblr/lib/
```

In Scumblr/config/initializers/ you will need to edit the scumblr.rb.sample file and add the API keys. I also provided a scumblr.rb file already configured with the onion custom search provider. Just add the API keys. Instructions below!

```
$ mv scumblr.rb.sample scumblr.rb
# Add keys and uncomment ones in use
$ vi scumblr.rb
```


### Google Custom Search Providers

### Pastebin Custom Search Provider
- The pastebin search provider requires the pastebin pro API account for scraping, acquired here:
http://pastebin.com/pro
- Then enter the public IP address of your server into this page http://pastebin.com/api_scraping_faq
- The data is scraped from the pastebin site and the query terms are compared in memory on this machine
- When using query field, entries can be a single string or multiple entries delineated by ;
- I recommend creating 1 pastebin job that runs every 10-20 minutes and pulls the last 500 paste's. This query can contain all of your searchstrings separated by a ;


### 4chan and 8ch Custom Search Providers
- These search providers utilize APIs that do not require any registration or access
- The data is scraped from the channels and the query terms are compared in memory on this machine


### YouTube Search Provider
